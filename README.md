# Scrolling Image Project

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.5.

We are using flickr API to load images. Each time we call the API, it will give us new list of Images. 
https://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?format=json

Requiremet
1. We need to load images on page load.
2. Upon scrolling to bottom, new images will be added.
3. If we keep on scrolling to bottom, new images should keep on loading.
4. This is similiar to showing products in Amazon.com
